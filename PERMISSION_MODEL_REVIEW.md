### 1 游리 PERMISSION STORAGE FORMAT IS NOT VERSIONED PROPERLY

**Problem:** While there's a `version` field, there's no migration logic or version checking.

**Location:** `src/permissions/storage.rs:9-15`

  ```rust
  pub struct PermissionsFile {
    pub version: u32,  // 丘멆잺 No migration logic
    pub allow: Vec<PermissionRule>,
    pub deny: Vec<PermissionRule>,
}
  ```

**Issues:**

- Version field exists but is never checked
- No migration path if format changes
- Could break on version mismatch
- No validation of loaded data

**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM - Future maintenance burden

**Recommendation:**

- Add version validation on load
- Implement migration framework
- Handle unknown versions gracefully
- Add schema validation

### 2 游리 PATTERN MATCHING LOGIC IS FRAGMENTED

**Problem:** Pattern matching logic exists in multiple places with different implementations.

**Locations:**

- `storage.rs:118-145` (PermissionRule::matches)
- `bash.rs:50-150` (dangerous command detection)
- File tools (path validation)

**Issues:**

- Inconsistent pattern syntax
- No shared pattern matching library
- Hard to maintain and test
- Potential for bugs in edge cases

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Maintenance burden, potential security issues

**Recommendation:**

- Create unified pattern matching module
- Use established glob library consistently
- Document pattern syntax clearly
- Add comprehensive pattern tests

### 3 游리 GOD OBJECT: PermissionManager

**Problem:** `PermissionManager` does too many things.

**Responsibilities:**

1. Permission checking
2. User interaction (via events)
3. Persistence management
4. Cache management (via PermissionsFile)
5. Project root management
6. Request ID generation

**Lines of Code:** 350+ in single file

**Violation:** Single Responsibility Principle

**Recommendation:**

- Split into: `PermissionChecker`, `PermissionStorage`, `PermissionUI`
- Use composition over god object
- Each class has single, clear responsibility

### 4 游댮 PATH VALIDATOR: INCOMPLETE SYMLINK PROTECTION

**Problem:** Path validation doesn't fully protect against symlink attacks.

**Location:** `src/security/path_validator.rs:35-70`

**Issue:** For non-existent paths, only the parent is canonicalized. A symlink in the path chain could escape the
working directory.

**Attack scenario:**

  ```bash
  # Attacker creates symlink in working dir
  ln -s /etc evil_dir
  # Tool creates file in evil_dir/passwd
  # Path validator checks parent (working_dir) but file ends up in /etc/passwd
  ```

**Impact:** HIGH - Potential security bypass

**Recommendation:**

- Recursively resolve all path components
- Reject paths containing symlinks by default
- Add explicit symlink policy configuration
- Test with nested symlink scenarios

### 5 游리 BASH TOOL: BYPASSABLE DANGEROUS COMMAND DETECTION

**Problem:** Blacklist approach to dangerous commands is easily bypassed.

**Location:** `src/tools/bash.rs:50-120`

**Bypass examples:**

  ```bash
  r\m -rf /              # Escaped character
  $(echo rm) -rf /       # Command substitution
  rm${IFS}-rf /          # Variable expansion
  'r''m' -rf /           # Quote concatenation
  ```

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Security feature can be circumvented

**Recommendation:**

- Switch to whitelist: only allow safe commands
- Use shell parser (e.g., `shell-words` crate)
- Sandbox bash execution (containers, restricted shell)
- Add explicit dangerous command confirmation

  ---

### 6 游리 INSUFFICIENT TEST COVERAGE

**Current state:**

- 14 unit tests for permissions
- Tests mostly focus on happy path
- Missing edge cases and error conditions
- No integration tests

**Missing test scenarios:**

- Concurrent permission requests
- Permission file corruption
- Race conditions in cache
- Symlink attack scenarios
- Pattern matching edge cases
- Error recovery

**Recommendation:**

- Achieve 80%+ code coverage
- Add property-based tests for pattern matching
- Add concurrency tests
- Test error paths explicitly
