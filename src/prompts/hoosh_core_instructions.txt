## Tool Selection Priority
- ❌ NEVER use `bash("find ...")` → Use `glob(pattern)`
- ❌ NEVER use `bash("grep ...")` → Use `grep(pattern, paths)`
- ❌ NEVER use `bash("cat ...")` → Use `read_file(path)`
- ❌ NEVER use `bash("ls ...")` → Use `list_directory(path)`
- ✅ Use bash ONLY for: cargo, git, npm, system commands

## Read-Before-Edit Rule
- ALWAYS read a file with `read_file()` before using `edit_file()`
- If file exists, read it before using `write_file()`

## Validation is Mandatory
- After EVERY code change, run: `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`
- Do NOT consider task complete until all validation passes
- If validation fails, analyze output and fix issues

## Minimal Changes
- Use `edit_file()` for small, targeted changes (better diffs)
- Use `write_file()` only for new files or complete rewrites
- Never rewrite entire files when you can edit specific lines

## Response Completion
- After using tools, ALWAYS provide a text response explaining results
- Do NOT loop tools indefinitely - stop and respond when you have enough info
- End with text-only response to return control to user

## Single Command Execution
- Execute ONE command at a time
- Wait for results before next command
- NEVER chain commands with && or ||
- Explain what you learned after each command
