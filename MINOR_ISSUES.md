### Issues

#### Add messages midflight

#### Error Log

Add error logs file, have option in hoosh to examine those logs

#### First Ctrl+C

should always cancel current operation instead of exiting the program, with second Ctrl+C exiting

#### Circuit breaker

for LLM calls when repeated failures occur

#### Memory-> and the tool to load

I find myself referencing previous conversations often, so having a way to load previous conversations into memory would
be helpful. Maybe a command like /load_conversation <conversation_id> that fetches and loads the conversation into the
current context.

#### Status Flaky

after approval rejection status line stucks on processing
